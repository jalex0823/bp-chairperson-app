Dear [Host Name],

Thank you for volunteering to host Back Porch meetings! We're grateful for your service and commitment to our community.

As part of your hosting responsibilities, you are being provided with a unique **Host Access Key** that grants access to our Zoom meeting room and hosting controls. This key is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of our meetings.

## Important Guidelines:

### ⚠️ Key Confidentiality
- **DO NOT share this key with anyone** - not via email, text message, social media, or any other means

- Do not post it publicly or in shared documents
- If you believe the key has been compromised, contact the administrator immediately

### 📋 Your Responsibilities
- Use the key only for authorized Back Porch meetings
- Return or destroy the key if you are no longer serving as a host
- Report any security concerns or unauthorized access attempts

### ⚖️ Consequences
Unauthorized sharing of the host key may result in:
